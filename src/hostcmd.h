/*
  Arculator - Acorn Archimedes emulator

  HostCmd - expose the guest RISC OS command line to the host.
  Ported from RPCEmu-extended (Andy Timmins); protocol unchanged.

  The host connects to a local socket and submits command lines; a RISC OS
  gateway module (RPCEmuSupport from RPCEmu-extended, shipped here in the
  Arculator support extension ROM) polls the emulator for those commands via
  the ArcEm HostCmd SWI, runs each through OS_CLI capturing its output, and
  hands the output back over the same SWI to be streamed to the host.

 * Running a command from inside the emulator.

 * The channel was built for an outside client (rpcemu-run, the MCP server), but
 * the emulator itself has reason to ask the guest things: whether a module a
 * package needs is present, running a package's install triggers, telling the
 * Filer to re-read a directory it has cached.
 *
 * These share the same single-command machinery, so an internal command and an
 * external client take turns rather than interleaving.
 *
 * ALL OF THESE RUN ON THE EMULATOR THREAD, like everything else here, so there
 * is still no locking. A caller on another thread (the GUI) must reach them
 * through the emulator's command queue, and gets the result back through the
 * completion callback below - which is also called on the emulator thread.
